HomeButtonLock
==============

A mobileconfig profile that, when installed, will lock the home button on an iOS device.

BEWARE
Once this profile is installed the first app that is launched when the device is rebooted will be the only app that will run until you reboot the device again.

You must reboot (power off, power on) the device after installing the profile for the changes to take effect. To remove the profile from the device, you must plug the device into IPCU and delete it, then reboot the device. Everything should go back to normal.
